# Introduction 
This is basically a hello world app, just showing a star wars character. In this case, Darth Vader. It is a project meant to be a proof of concept using GitHub as source code repository to house a demo for unit and integration testing with Cypress.io.

# Getting Started
This is a basic nodejs application using the express module's scaffolding to instantiate a web server and show a very simple page. It also intends to demonstrate automated tests as part of the application.

# Build and Test
Builds with NPM install. Build should be gated on tests passing. Tests are triggered from the npm test command, which in turn executes the requisite cy.run commands.
